<h1>Letters of Recommendation</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Things I'll need from you</h2>
<p>
    There are a number of things that I need you to supply to me when you
    request that I send a letter of recommendation on your behalf.
</p>
<h3>1. Sufficient time to write the letter</h3>
<p>
    Initial requests for a letter of recommendation should be made at
    least a <em>month</em> ahead of the first due date.  It takes some time
    to craft a good letter of recommendation, often they come during a busy
    portion of the semester, and other students are often requesting
    letters at the same time.  With less lead time, you run the risk that my 
    letter might not be ready by the deadline.
</p>
<p>
    However, after the initial letter has been written, it is much easier
    to fulfill subsequent requests.  I only request a <em>week</em> of lead
    time for these and students should never feel guilty that they are
    submitting additional applications.
</p>

<h3>2. A current resume/vita</h3>
<p>
    Note: this does not need to be completely polished, but should be
    up-to-date.  You might want to add in things for me that might be
    useful describing your involvement in CS. (E.g., when you were a TA and
    for which CS class, which programming contest you participated in,
    were on CSMC, designed a t-shirt, relevant ExCos, etc.)
</p>
<p>
    While we may have discussed your extracurriculars (activities, jobs,
    etc.) and I might have even employed you as a grader/lab TA, I do get
    fuzzy on the details (how many semesters and when were they?), and when
    in doubt I will leave things out of my letter.
</p>

<h3>3. Supplemental writing that the application requests</h3>
<p>
    Most applications require you write one or more essays as part of your
    application.  Having a copy of these, even if they are in a draft or
    outline state, are very useful.  I like to be able to make the pieces
    of my letter fit together with the overall message you are making by
    reinforcing things in your statement and also emphasizing things that I
    believe are important for the reader to know, but might have been only
    briefly mentioned.
</p>

<h3>4. <strong>CLEARLY</strong> listed dates and destinations</h3>
<p>
    You should list the date each letter is due and how it is to be
    submitted.  For example, grad school applications might be broken down
    into the following categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Send email directly (give email address with details)</li>
    <li>Send physical letter to (give full mailing address and intended recipient)</li>
    <li>Online form -- should receive an email shortly</li>
    <li>Will contact you only if needed</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Giving me a list that is broken down into these categories with each
    school grouped under the appropriate heading 
    gives me a list to check things against and also will let me know
    if I need to check my SPAM folder for email notifications that might
    have been incorrectly identified.
</p>

<p>
    Sorting each group by due date with the nearest ones at the top will
    ensure that they get handled in the correct order.
</p>

<p>
    I will contact you when I've submitted the letter of recommendation for
    you.  <em>If you haven't heard anything and the deadline is approaching,
        feel free to check in with me to be sure I'm not missing anything or
            that I've forgotten.</em> I'm usually pretty organized, but sometimes
    things do fall through the cracks.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Other advice</h2>
<p>
    Have someone look over your application materials before you submit
    them.  Most faculty would be happy to look over things like your essay
    or resume and offer advice about how you might improve them.  We've
    seen many of these over time, and having outside ideas often helps you
    craft a better statement.  
</p>

<p>
    To make a strong positive recommendation, I need to know who you are
    and what your goals are.  Just coming to class and getting an A is
    nice, but it doesn't give me much more to say other than comment on
    your academic ability in that class.
    There are many ways to become more involved: ask questions in class,
    come to office hours, participate on the contest teams, become a lab
    TA, advising sessions, the dining hall's FAST program, etc.
