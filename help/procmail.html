<h1>Procmail hints</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.procmail.org/">Procmail</a> is a very useful tool for
processing and filtering your mail.  On OCCS, new accounts are created with a
few simple procmail rules included.  However, you might want to add more in
and/or change things around.
</p>

<h2>Basic elements</h2>
<p>
    Procmail is run automatically as part of the normal mail delivery process.
    You can control the behavior of procmail by creating/modifying a special
    file called <tt>.procmailrc</tt>.
</p>
<p>
    Here is what a sample file looks like:
</p>
<pre class="boxed">
<code>
SHELL=/bin/sh
MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail	# make sure this exists!

# Anything with a score over 10 goes away.  15 would be safer, but in several
# months of testing I have had zero false hits that scored between 10 and 15.
:0:
* ^X-Spam-Level: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
/dev/null

# Forward everything else to your Oberlin account
:0
! Your.Name@oberlin.edu
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
<tt>SHELL</tt> is used when running programs from within procmail.
<tt>MAILDIR</tt> is used as the prefix for where emails could be filed away
(if delivered locally).
</p>

<p>
You can enable logging by adding in a line just after the <tt>MAILDIR</tt>
one:
</p>
<pre class="boxed">
<code>
LOGFILE=$HOME/.procmail.log
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    This is useful when you are trying to debug things or just to have a
    record of mail received.  Beware that this file will continue growing!
</p>

<h2>Mail forwarding</h2>
<p>
    The last rule says to forward everything else to a different account.  You
    can change the email address and have things sent somewhere else (e.g.,
    GMail) or even to multiple accounts if you so choose.
</p>
<p>
    Delete all three lines to end forwarding.  You now will need to check your
    email on OCCS.
</p>

<h2>Spamassassin and Procmail</h2>
<p>
    The rule given above deletes everything with a spamassassin score of 10 or
    more.  However, spamassassin might have marked things as being spam with a
    lower score than that.  You can add in the following rule after the first
    to file away probable spam messages to be gone through manually.
</p>

<pre class="boxed">
<code>
# Probable spam goes into Junk
:0:
* ^X-Spam-Flag: YES
Junk
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Note that we don't have to specify where the mailbox is because of the value
of <tt>MAILDIR</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Preventing mail deletion</h2>
<p>
    One thing I worry about is having mail from students be labeled as spam
    and deleted.  To prevent this, I tell students to include the course
    number in the subject line.
</p>

<pre class="boxed">
<code>
### make sure I get class mail
:0:
* ^Subject:.*(cs|csci).*[0-9][0-9][0-9]
/var/mail/username
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    If this recipe is the first one in my <tt>.procmailrc</tt> file, then I
    can guarantee none of their email gets lost.  Well, only if they can
    follow directions!
</p>
